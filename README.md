## Overview

![screenshot](/public/screenshot.png)

A simple portfolio project realized following a figma design from devchallenges.io. The Website is built with NextJs, React, @MUI/material, Twilio SendGrid and StoryblokCMS. 

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [@MUI/material](https://mui.com/)
- [Twilio Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
- [Storyblok CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge to build a website given a Figma design file. I personally decided to deviate a bit from the original design and adapt it to my needs. 
This Project is built with the NextJs framework and hosted on vercel platform.@MUI/material is used for styling and Twilio Sendgrid to handle contact form follow up. The contact form input is sent to the backend route /api/contact for further validation and it sends the email to admin and a confirmation to the user. All the content is managed through StoryblokCMS, allowing for greater flexibility with the design and website content, given the most important @MUI/material components are ported so they can be used directly in storyblok dashboard
